## Employment History

I currently work as member of technical staff at Draper in Cambridge, MA where I've been since 2016. There, I work on building software tools in Python for data analysis. Sometimes this involves writing packages for machine learning, and other times it involves building applications for data visualization. 

## Education History

In 2016 I graduated from Harvard College with a B.A. in Physics. In 2020, I graduated from Tufts University with an M.S. in Data Scienc while working full time at Draper

## Personal
In my free time I take part in adult-league soccer (for some reason I still like to specify that it's "adult") or take my dog Kepler out on adventures (pictured below).
