## Employment History

I currently work as a data scientist at Dexai in Somerville, MA. I am member of the learning team and am currently working on deploying machine learning algorithms for robots.

From August 2016 to July 2020 I worked as a member of technical staff at Draper Laboratory in Cambridge, MA. There, I worked on building software tools in Python for data analysis. Sometimes this involved writing packages for machine learning, and other times it involves building applications for data visualization. 

## Education History

In 2016 I graduated from Harvard College with a B.A. in Physics. In 2020, I graduated from Tufts University with an M.S. in Data Science while working full time at Draper

## Personal
In my free time I take part in adult-league soccer (for some reason I still like to specify that it's "adult") or take my dog Kepler out on adventures (pictured below).
