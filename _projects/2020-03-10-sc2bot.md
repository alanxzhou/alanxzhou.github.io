# SC2Bot
SC2Bot is a deep reinforcement model that plays StarCraft II minigames: the Move To Beacon game and the Defeat Roaches game, both of which are provided as part of Deepmind's PySC2 package. SC2Bot uses PySC2's API to read data from StarCraft II, and the RL models are written in PyTorch.

## StarCraft II: A Quick Introduction

Starcraft II is a popular real time strategy video game in which players collect resources, build buildings, and create armies of units. In a 1v1 setting the game is won when one player has destroyed all of the other players' buildings. Starcraft II can be thought of as a form of high-speed chess, where moves are performed in real time and players utilize both strategy and speed of action to win. 

As a reinforcement learning problem, Starcraft II presents a combination of challenges that is not typically found in other traditional game-based reinforcement learning problems:

* Multi-Agent Interaction
* Imperfect Knowledge
* Delayed Credit Assignment
* ‘Continuous’ Environment
* Massive State-Action Space

The most well known way of overcoming these difficulties is to use an extremely high amount of computing power (e.g., see Deepmind's Alphastar[^1]). But given limited resources, what are some other ways we might be able to train an agent within a reasonable amount of time?

### Experiment Design

## Move To Beacon Task
In the Move To Beacon task, the agent controls a single marine. A green beacon is spawned randomly on the map and the goal of the game is for the marine to move to the beacon. Every time the marine touches the beacon, the agent is awarded one point and the becaon spawns randomly at another location on the map. The agent is restricted to an action space of only allowing it to move to any point on the map, discretized into a 32x32 grid.

## Defeat Roaches Task
In the Defeat Roaches Task, the agent controls an army of 8 marines that are spawned randomly on the map and 4 roaches are spawned randomly opposite them. Defeating the roaches spawns 5 new marines and 4 new roaches. The agent is rewarded for defeating roaches and penalized for time passing by and for attacking it's own units (so that the agent doesn't use a strategy of attacking its own units to minimize the amount of time passing by)
