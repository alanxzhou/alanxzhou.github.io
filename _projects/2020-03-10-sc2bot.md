## StarCraft II: A quick Introduction	

Starcraft II is a popular real time strategy video game in which players collect resources, build buildings, and create armies of units. In a 1v1 setting the game is won when one player has destroyed all of the other players' buildings. Starcraft II can be thought of as a form of high-speed chess, where moves are performed in real time and players utilize both strategy and speed of action to win. 

As a reinforcement learning problem, Starcraft II presents a combination of challenges that are not typically found in other traditional game-based reinforcement learning problems:

* Multi-Agent Interaction
* Imperfect Knowledge
* Delayed Credit Assignment
* ‘Continuous’ Environment
* Massive State-Action Space
* High Computation Power Required

## Reinforcement Learning Techniques

### Deep Q-Learning

### Experience Replay

### Double DQns

### Transfer Learning

**Obviously,** we’ve styled up *all the basic* text formatting options [available in markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).


And footnotes[^1], which link to explanations[^2] at the bottom of the page[^3].

[^1]: Beautiful modern, minimal theme design.
[^2]: Powerful features to show off your work.
[^3]: Maintained and supported by the theme developer.

You can throw in some horizontal rules too:

### Image galleries

Here's a really neat custom feature we added – galleries:

<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-square.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>

Inspired by the Galleries feature from WordPress, we've made it easy to create grid layouts for your images. Just use a bit of simple HTML in your post to create a masonry grid image layout:

```html
<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-square.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>
```

*See what we did there? Code and syntax highlighting is built-in too!*

Change the number inside the 'columns' setting to create different types of gallery for all kinds of purposes. You can even click on each image to seamlessly enlarge it on the page.

### The mini games

<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
	<img src="/images/sc2bot/beacon_start.png">
	<img src="/images/sc2bot/roach_start.png">
	<figcaption> 
	Start of the Beacon game (first image) and start of the Defeat Roaches game (second image) 
	</figcaption>
</div>

### What about videos?

Videos are an awesome way to show off your work in a more engaging and personal way, and we’ve made sure they work great on our themes. Just paste an embed code from YouTube or Vimeo, and the theme makes sure it displays perfectly:

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/19536258?color=ffffff&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
