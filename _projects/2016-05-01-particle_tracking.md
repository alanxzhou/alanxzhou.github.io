# Bayesian Particle Tracking
Bayesian Particle Tracking was one of final projects of my undergraduate degree at Harvard. It is a Python package that calculates the diffusion coefficient for a diffusion process in 3D particle tracking given a trajectory and the uncertainty on the measurments in that trajectory.
